Week 8 Homework Project

### Description

This project is designed to simulate a Patient Database. The database is populated with random patients who each have a random doctor. Patients are able to be added to the database by the user. The user is able to return a single patient, as well as return the entire list of patients in the database. When the entire list is returned, the user can click on the patient's name to go directly to that patient's information page. From the patient's page, the user is able to update or delete that patient. The update fields will already be populated with the patient's information, allowing the user to change what is needed to be changed. If the patient is deleted, the user is directed to another page informing the user that the patient can not be found.
* Any patient relations to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.
