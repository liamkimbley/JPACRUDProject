## JPACRUDProject

Week 8 Homework Project

### Description

This project is designed to simulate a Patient Database. The database is populated with random patients who each have a random doctor. Patients are able to be added to the database by the user. The user is able to return a single patient, as well as return the entire list. When the entire list is returned, the user can click on the patient's name to go directly to that patient's page. From the patient's page, the user is able to update or delete that patient.
* Any patient relations to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.
